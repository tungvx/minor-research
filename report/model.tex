\label{sec:model}
Our system is developed based on the framework in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}. The process of building logical formulas from a natural language sentence is presented in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}.
As mentioned, each parser system has a model containing data to be used for translating a natural language sentence to formal representation. Similar to \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}, model in our system consists of two parts: Word-Function feature calculator and Function-Function feature calculator.
