\subsection{Token-Function feature vector calculator}
\label{sec:model.word-function}
This component is in charge of computing feature vector given a token and a function. Each function is configured to have a set of surface forms, which are typically associated with the function. The feature vector is calculated by comparing the token with these surface forms. Thus, the larger the number of surface forms is, the more accurate the feature vector is. Similar to \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}, we restrict the number of surface forms per function. In our current experiment, there is average 1.39 words per functions, in comparison with 1.42 of \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}.

The feature vector is generated based on lexical matching between token and surface forms. Many cases in Vietnamese, two words with lexical similarity may have the same meaning. For example "{\fontencoding{T5}\selectfont Ti\h\ecircumflex u bang" and "bang" both have meaning as "state". Similary, we have "con s\ocircumflex ng" and "s\ocircumflex ng" (river), "ng\d{o}n n\'ui" and "n\'ui", etc.}
