There has been not many works in Vietnamese semantic parsing. \citeauthor{Nguyen:2009:VQA:1681518.1683170} in \cite{Nguyen:2009:VQA:1681518.1683170} developed a question answering system for Vietnamese. The system enable users to query an ontological knowledge base using pattern matching. This is not really sematic parsing but semantic interpretation. The method here is simple and very difficult to scale to large database.
