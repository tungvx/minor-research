\section{Computer-understandable language}
\label{sec:c-u}

The representation of meaning (the result of semantic parsing) depends on each system and need to be unified. In our system, the format of "Computer-understandable language" is composition of pre-defined functions. Each function has only one argument. For example, $capital(stateid("alaska"))$ is a CUL sentence, being a result of semantic parsing for "Thủ phủ của alaska là gì?" ("What is the capital of alaska?").
