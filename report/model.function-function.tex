\subsection{Function - Function feature vector calculator}
\label{sec:model.function-function}
Suppose we need to compute the feature vector of $f_1$ and $f_2$ when we want to form $f_1(f_2)$. The most important note is that returned type of $f_2$ must agree with argument type of $f_1$. The second feature is the distance between the tokens corresponding to two functions in the sentence. If the distance is small, they will have more chances to be composed. This is due to the usual speaking style. Let us consider the following example: \\
 "{\fontencoding{T5}\selectfont con s\ocircumflex ng n\`ao ch\h{a}y qua ti\h\ecircumflex u bang missisipi?" ("what river runs through state mississippi?").
