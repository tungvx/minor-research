Semantic parsing is a very important process in Natural Language Processing, helping computers to "understand" natural languages. Generally, semantic parsing converts a natural language sentence into a special representation so that computers can read and process it. We call that special representation as "Computer-understandable language". An effective way to do this task is using learning methods to build a model of relationship between natural language structure and "Computer-understandable language" (CUL) structure. Unfortunately, most of the current approaches require very large amounts of fully annotated data in order to obtain a good model. Annotated data means that for each input sentence of natural language, we need the corresponding result sentence of "Computer-understandable language". The later is almost prepared manually by human, which takes a lot of efforts. 

Recently, \citeauthor{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571} implemented a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision burden. The algorithm is able to predict complex structures which only rely on a binary feedback. Borrowing the idea from these authors, we developed "Vietnamese geometric question answering system" (VGQAS). The core of the system is semantic parser.
