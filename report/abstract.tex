Based on the framework in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}, we developed a Vietnamese question answering system. The learning paradigm in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571} reduces the burden of providing supervision during semantic parsing. Whilst taking the advantages from this mechanism, we also create our own feature calculation which is suitable for Vietnamese. A method of dynamic learning for feature computation is also presented in this work.
