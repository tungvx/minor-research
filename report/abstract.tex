Based on the framework in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}, we developed a Vietnamese question answering system. The machine learning mechanism in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571} reduces the burden of providing supervision during semantic parsing. Whilst taking the advantages from this mechanism, we also add features calculations which are more suitable, more natural to Vietnamese.
