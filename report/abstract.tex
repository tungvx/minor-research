Based on the framework in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571}, we developed a Vietnamese question answering system. The machine learning mechanisms in \cite{Clarke:2010:DSP:1870568.1870571} reduces the burden of providing supervision during semantic parsing. Whilst taking the advantages from these mechanisms, we also create our own feature calculations which are more suitable, more natural to Vietnamese. A method of dynamic learning of features is also presented in this work.
